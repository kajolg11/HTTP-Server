                    <p>Computer Network is a group of computers connected with each other through wires, optical fibres or optical links so that various devices can interact with each other through a network.
                    <p>The aim of the computer network is the sharing of resources among various devices.
                    <p>n the case of computer network technology, there are several types of networks that vary from simple to complex level.

                    <article>
                        <p>Computer Network Architecture is defined as the physical and logical design of the software, hardware, protocols, and media of the transmission of data. Simply we can say that how computers are organized and how tasks are allocated to the computer.
                        <p>
                        The two types of network architectures are used:
                            <li>Peer-To-Peer network</li>
                            <li>Client/Server network</li>

                        </p>
                       
                       <h3>Peer-To-Peer network</h3>
                       <li>Peer-To-Peer network is a network in which all the computers are linked together with equal privilege and responsibilities for processing the data.</li>
                       <li>Peer-To-Peer network is useful for small environments, usually up to 10 computers.</li>
                       <li>Peer-To-Peer network has no dedicated server.</li>
                       <li>Special permissions are assigned to each computer for sharing the resources, but this can lead to a problem if the computer with the resource is down.</li>
                       
                       <h3>Client/Server Network</h3>
                       <li>Client/Server network is a network model designed for the end users called clients, to access the resources such as songs, video, etc. from a central computer known as Server.</li>
                       <li>The central controller is known as a server while all other computers in the network are called clients.</li>
                       <li>A server performs all the major operations such as security and network management.</li>
                       <li>A server is responsible for managing all the resources such as files, directories, printer, etc.</li>
                       <li>All the clients communicate with each other through a server. For example, if client1 wants to send some data to client 2, then it first sends the request to the server for the permission. The server sends the response to the client 1 to initiate its communication with the client 2.</li>

                    <article>
                        Computer network components are the major parts which are needed to install the software. Some important network components are NIC, switch, cable, hub, router, and modem. Depending on the type of network that we need to install, some network components can also be removed. For example, the wireless network does not require a cable.

                    <p>A computer network is a group of computers linked to each other that enables the computer to communicate with another computer and share their resources, data, and applications.</p>
                    <p>A computer network can be categorized by their size. A computer network is mainly of four types:</p>
                    <li>LAN(Local Area Network)</li>
                    <li>PAN(Personal Area Network)</li>
                    <li>MAN(Metropolitan Area Network)</li>
                    <li>WAN(Wide Area Network)</li>
